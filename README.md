This is my personal experimental GSP satellite visualization project. This project includes the NMEA GPS message parser (Java) and the visualizer application (Processing). It worked with M5Stack's GPS Unit (AT6558) in my location. See the video at https://youtu.be/IK79sHW0ylA .

- To try the application, modify the configuration in gpsvisualizer/GPSVisualizer.pde and run it on Processing 3.
- If you changed the parser code (under nmeagps directory), run build-nmeagps.bat to rebuild the jar and deploy to the application folder.
