This is my personal experimental GSP satellite visualization project. This project includes the NMEA GPS message parser (Java) and the visualizer application (Processing). It worked with M5Stack's GPS Unit (AT6558) in my location. See the video at https://youtu.be/IK79sHW0ylA .

- Open gpsvisualizer/GPSVisualizer.pde with Processing 3, change the serial port, and run.
- If you changed the parser (under nmeagps directory), run build-nmeagps.bat to rebuild the jar and deploy to the application folder.
